Until I learn more from the class itself I don’t think I can honestly answer this question due to not having enough information available at this time to answer it. </P><P> <strong> My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports, or Hobbies </strong> </P><P>	I’m a casual gamer, I listen to a variety of music from bluegrass, jazz, rock (various types), classical, country, metal, and of particular Irish folk music. I also enjoy going hiking and playing various puzzles and strategy games, like Sudoku, Chess, etc. </P><P> <strong> What I Hope to Gain from this Course </strong> </P><P>	A further understanding of the internet, the various tools available on it, and how to use them to make my life easier. </P><P> <strong> Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss or Learn About </strong> </P><P>	Web page design sounds like fun and also like a practical skill to have in this day and age. </P> </body></html>
