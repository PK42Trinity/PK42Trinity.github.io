     <h2>Why it's Innovative</h2>
     <h3>   Open-world video games are a type of video game where a player can roam freely through a virtual world and is given considerable freedom in choosing how or when to approach objectives. With the advent of Open World games players were no longer restricted to top-down or side-scrolling gameplay and game desingers were able to introduce many new as well as revamp old functions and features that were previouly not possible or to better represent them. The term "Open World" in games is often incorrectly referred to as "sandbox". Similar to how a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't always nessicarily a square.</h3>
