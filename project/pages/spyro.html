     <h2>Why it's Innovative</h2>
     <h3>   What makes this method of Anti-Piracy so innovative and effective is the fact that it does not atttempt to directly combat illegal attempts to copy the games data but instead the data of the game itself is set up so that should someone attempt to play a pirated copy the game will initially play like normal. This is so that the piraters will not realize there is anything wrong with their process. Then as the game is played further and further along the game's programming will make it so that the play data is slowly corrupted and deleted making the game itself unplayable since the player will continusily be losing their save data, neccessary events that would allow them to procede will register as being incomplete, and overall attempting to finish a pirated copy of the game will be near impossible to do. In fact this method was so effective it remained uncracked for over a decade.</h3>
